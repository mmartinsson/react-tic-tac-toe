# Improvements for Tic-Tac-Toe React tutorial

This is my solution for the extra improvements suggested at the end of this awesome [Tutorial: Intro to React](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html).

## Original improvements

In case the original page gets changed these were the improvements when I played around with them. They are in order of increasing difficulty:

1. Display the location for each move in the format (col, row) in the move history list. [Issue #2](https://github.com/mmartinsson/react-tic-tac-toe/issues/2)
2. Bold the currently selected item in the move list. [Issue #3](https://github.com/mmartinsson/react-tic-tac-toe/issues/3)
3. Rewrite Board to use two loops to make the squares instead of hardcoding them. [Issue #4](https://github.com/mmartinsson/react-tic-tac-toe/issues/4)
4. Add a toggle button that lets you sort the moves in either ascending or descending order. [Issue #5](https://github.com/mmartinsson/react-tic-tac-toe/issues/5)
5. When someone wins, highlight the three squares that caused the win. [Issue #6](https://github.com/mmartinsson/react-tic-tac-toe/issues/6)
6. When no one wins, display a message about the result being a draw. [Issue #7](https://github.com/mmartinsson/react-tic-tac-toe/issues/7)

## My own Improvements

I also did some improvements of my own. See the other [Issues](https://github.com/mmartinsson/react-tic-tac-toe/issues)
